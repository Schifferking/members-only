This project is part of The Odin's Project Ruby on Rails course.<br>
It uses concepts learned from previous lessons (e.g. authentication and authorization) to make a page where users can log in, create posts and log out. Also it hides the author's name of all the posts to users who haven't logged. The posts remain visible to everyone.
